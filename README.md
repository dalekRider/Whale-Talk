# Whale-Talk
Simple program that translates text to "whale speak".

*** Whale Translator ***

This project is a modified version of the whale translator project found on Codecademy. The program translates text provided by the user into "Whale Speak". Essentially it removes the consonants from the input text and rebuilds the string using only vowels. If the text contains any "e's" or "u's" those vowels are then doubled. The resulting string is a vowel laden word that sounds like whale speak.

The original solution for Codecademy only declared variables, iterated through the arrays and then output to console. I have wrapped this within a function, changed the input variable to a prompt and then output the results using an alert. The prompt will eventually be changed to an input text field. I will add a button tied to the whaleTalk function and then the output will append an element on the page.

I have included the original solution I used to complete the project. This is for comparison purposes as well as to help anyone that may be struggling with complete this or a similar project.
